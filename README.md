Run `npm install` and then run `ng serve` to open the project on `localhost:4200`


## General notes

Relevant unit tests can be found in; 
 - `ideas.service.spec.ts`
 - `ideas.component.spec.ts`

What I'd do given more time; 
 - Extend/Improve animations
 - Modularise/Componentise more of the features especially around the ideas module
 - More unit tests
 - Add some more polish to the design and colour scheme
 - Consider abstracting away the store element from the ideaService and having a store service as a seperate service that new services can hook into later
